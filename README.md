Project: Develop a Comprehensive Quiz Application

A simple, responsive web-based quiz application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app dynamically fetches quiz questions from an external API and allows users to navigate, answer questions, and view their final score.

Features:
- Dynamic question loading using the [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com).
- Single-question view with radio button options.
- Next and Previous navigation with smart enable/disable logic.
- Submit button appears only on the final question, after a selection is made.
- Score calculation with correct/incorrect breakdown and percentage.
- Error handling for API and input validation.
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.
